# Project-Meteorite-Landings-on-Earth-
Cosmic Landing Analytics is a data-driven project that uses a meteorite dataset from Data.gov (NASA) to explore trends in meteorite landings. By combining Python for data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling with interactive Power BI dashboards, I uncovered key insights on mass distribution, temporal trends, and geospatial patterns.
